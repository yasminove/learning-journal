                <h2>How I stay committed to learning</h2>

                <p>
                    I like to think of myself as a lifelong learner. I used to spend hours and hours learning, then
                    try
                    to
                    create simple projects using what I learned or work new techniques into existing projects.

                    While that was fun, I felt like it would be helpful to share what I was learning and most things
                    about
                    my journey with the world.
                </p>

                <h2>How I got started</h2>

                <p>
                    I started simple and gradually grew my learning journal site. I would take notes about what I
                    was
                    learning. After each learning session, I'd use my notes to not only reflect on what I learned
                    but
                    also
                    write short summaries of what I learned using my own words.

                    That helped me grok what I was learning, and I realized that posting my learning summaries was
                    also
                    helping others learn and stay motivated.
